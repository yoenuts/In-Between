# In-Between
Inspired by a card betting game blockmates used to kill time(and murder their wallets) with. A mini GUI program in Java using JavaFX

Game Mechanics:

Player must guess if the value of the next card from deck is between the value of 2 cards in hand. 

- If the player guessses correctly, the round goes on and the player gains a point
- If the player guesses incorrectly, the round will end and all player points will be tallied.

This is a 1P game. Will soon reconstruct it for multiple players and improve graphics : )
